	abstract = {Metallic materials are among the most crucial engineering materials widely utilized as biomaterials owing to their significant thermal conductivity, mechanical characteristics, and biocompatibility. Although these metallic biomedical implants, such as stainless steel, gold, silver, dental amalgams, Co-Cr, and Ti alloys, are generally used for bone tissue regeneration and repairing bodily tissue, the need for innovative technologies is required owing to the sensitivity of medical applications and to avoid any potential harmful reactions, thereby improving the implant to bone integration and prohibiting infection lea by corrosion and excessive stress. Taking this into consideration, several research and developments in biomaterial surface modification are geared toward resolving these issues in bone-related medical therapies/implants offering a substantial influence on cell adherence, increasing the longevity of the implant and rejuvenation along with the expansion in cell and molecular biology expertise. The primary objective of this review is to reaffirm the significance of surface modification of biomedical implants by enlightening numerous significant physical surface modifications, including ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification, thermal spraying, ion implantation, glow discharge plasma, electrophoretic deposition, and physical vapor deposition. Furthermore, we also focused on the characteristics of some commonly used biomedical alloys, such as stainless steel, Co-Cr, and Ti alloys.},

	abstract = {Functionally gradient bio-coating material was built by laser deposition. Co-Cr-Mo material was deposited on a Ti-6Al-4V substrate transitioning from 0\% to 100\%. Control over the cooling rate is shown to be a key to reduce the effects of thermal expansion differences of the materials. The microstructures and composition of the functionally gradient material (FGM) were characterized using an optical microscope, SEM, EDS, and XRD. EDS results showed a gradual transition to 50\% Co-Cr-Mo and ∼100\% Co-Cr-Mo on the top layer. XRD analysis showed the absence of a brittle intermetallic phase that forms between Titanium and Cobalt. As the amount of Co-Cr-Mo increased, the microhardness of the FGM samples significantly increased. A comparison was made between Co-Cr-Mo deposited on SS316L substrates as well as Ti-6Al-4V. The bonding strength of the coatings on both substrates was tested and found to meet the ASTM standard requirement. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {In the present study, compositionally-graded structures of AISI 316L and CoCrMo alloy are manufactured by powder-based laser-beam directed energy deposition (DED-LB). Through a process-integrated adjustment of powder flow, in situ alloying of the two materials becomes feasible. Thus, a sharp and a smooth transition with a mixture of both alloys can be realized. In order to investigate the phase formation during in situ alloying, a simulation approach considering equilibrium calculations is employed. The findings reveal that a precise compositional as well as functional gradation of the two alloys is possible. Thereby, the chemical composition can be directly correlated with the specimen hardness. Moreover, phases, which are identified by equilibrium calculations, can also be observed experimentally using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray-spectroscopy (EDS). Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) reveals epitaxial grain growth across the sharp transition region with a pronounced {\textless}001{\textgreater}-texture, while the smooth transition acts as nucleus for the growth of new grains with {\textless}101{\textgreater}-orientation. In light of envisaged applications in the biomedical sector, the present investigation demonstrates the high potential of an AISI 316L/CoCrMo alloy material combination.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Heat is a kinetic process whereby energy flows from between two systems, hot-to-cold objects. In oro-dental implantology, conductive heat transfer/(or thermal stress) is a complex physical phenomenon to analyze and consider in treatment planning. Hence, ample research has attempted to measure heat-production to avoid over-heating during bone-cutting and drilling for titanium (Ti) implant-site preparation and insertion, thereby preventing/minimizing early (as well as delayed) implant-related complications and failure. Objective: Given the low bone–thermal conductivity whereby heat generated by osteotomies is not effectively dissipated and tends to remain within the surrounding tissue (peri-implant), increasing the possibility of thermal-injury, this work attempts to obtain an exact analytical solution of the heat equation under exponential thermal-stress, modeling transient heat transfer and temperature changes in Ti implants (fixtures) upon hot-liquid oral intake. Materials and Methods: We, via an ex vivo-based model, investigated the impact of the (a) material, (b) location point along implant length, and (c) exposure time of the thermal load on localized temperature changes. Results: Despite its simplicity, the presented solution contains all the physics and reproduces the key features obtained in previous numerical analyses studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first introduction of the intrinsic time, a “proper” time that characterizes the geometry of the dental implant fixture, where we show, mathematically and graphically, how the interplay between “proper” time and exposure time influences temperature changes in Ti implants, under the suitable initial and boundary conditions. This fills the current gap in the literature by obtaining a simplified yet exact analytical solution, assuming an exponential thermal load model relevant to cold/hot beverage or food intake. Conclusions: This work aspires to accurately complement the overall clinical diagnostic and treatment plan for enhanced bone–implant interface, implant stability, and success rates, whether for immediate or delayed loading strategies.},
