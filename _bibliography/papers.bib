	abstract = {Metallic materials are among the most crucial engineering materials widely utilized as biomaterials owing to their significant thermal conductivity, mechanical characteristics, and biocompatibility. Although these metallic biomedical implants, such as stainless steel, gold, silver, dental amalgams, Co-Cr, and Ti alloys, are generally used for bone tissue regeneration and repairing bodily tissue, the need for innovative technologies is required owing to the sensitivity of medical applications and to avoid any potential harmful reactions, thereby improving the implant to bone integration and prohibiting infection lea by corrosion and excessive stress. Taking this into consideration, several research and developments in biomaterial surface modification are geared toward resolving these issues in bone-related medical therapies/implants offering a substantial influence on cell adherence, increasing the longevity of the implant and rejuvenation along with the expansion in cell and molecular biology expertise. The primary objective of this review is to reaffirm the significance of surface modification of biomedical implants by enlightening numerous significant physical surface modifications, including ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification, thermal spraying, ion implantation, glow discharge plasma, electrophoretic deposition, and physical vapor deposition. Furthermore, we also focused on the characteristics of some commonly used biomedical alloys, such as stainless steel, Co-Cr, and Ti alloys.},

Control over the cooling rate is shown to be a key to reduce the effects of thermal expansion differences of the materials. The microstructures and composition of the functionally gradient material (FGM) were characterized using an optical microscope, SEM, EDS, and XRD. EDS results showed a gradual transition to 50\% Co-Cr-Mo and ∼100\% Co-Cr-Mo on the top layer. XRD analysis showed the absence of a brittle intermetallic phase that forms between Titanium and Cobalt. As the amount of Co-Cr-Mo increased, the microhardness of the FGM samples significantly increased. A comparison was made between Co-Cr-Mo deposited on SS316L substrates as well as Ti-6Al-4V. The bonding strength of the coatings on both substrates was tested and found to meet the ASTM standard requirement. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {In the present study, compositionally-graded structures of AISI 316L and CoCrMo alloy are manufactured by powder-based laser-beam directed energy deposition (DED-LB). Through a process-integrated adjustment of powder flow, in situ alloying of the two materials becomes feasible. Thus, a sharp and a smooth transition with a mixture of both alloys can be realized. In order to investigate the phase formation during in situ alloying, a simulation approach considering equilibrium calculations is employed. The findings reveal that a precise compositional as well as functional gradation of the two alloys is possible. Thereby, the chemical composition can be directly correlated with the specimen hardness. Moreover, phases, which are identified by equilibrium calculations, can also be observed experimentally using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray-spectroscopy (EDS). Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) reveals epitaxial grain growth across the sharp transition region with a pronounced {\textless}001{\textgreater}-texture, while the smooth transition acts as nucleus for the growth of new grains with {\textless}101{\textgreater}-orientation. In light of envisaged applications in the biomedical sector, the present investigation demonstrates the high potential of an AISI 316L/CoCrMo alloy material combination.},

	abstract = {For implantable bioelectronic devices, the interface between the device and the biological environment requires significant attention as it dictates the device performance in vivo. Non-specific protein adsorption onto the device surface is the initial stage of many degradation mechanisms that will ultimately compromise the functionality of the device. In order to preserve the functionality of any implanted bioelectronics overtime, protein adsorption must be controlled. This review paper outlines two major approaches to minimize protein adsorption onto the surface of implantable electronics. The first approach is surface coating, which minimizes close proximity interactions between proteins and device surfaces by immobilizing electrically neutral hydrophilic polymers as surface coating. These coatings reduce protein fouling by steric repulsion and formation of a hydration layer which acts as both a physical and energetic barrier that minimize protein adsorption onto the device. Relevant performances of various conventional hydrophilic coatings are discussed. The second approach is surface patterning using arrays of hydrophobic nanostructures through photolithography techniques. By establishing a large slip length via super hydrophobic surfaces, the amount of proteins adsorbed to the surface of the device can be reduced. The last section discusses emerging surface coating techniques utilizing zwitterionic polymers where ultralow-biofouling surfaces have been demonstrated. These surface modification techniques may significantly improve the long-term functionality of implantable bioelectronics, thus allowing researchers to overcome challenges to diagnose and treat chronic neurological and cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {Powder suction modules for additive manufacturing systems in the field of multi-material laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) have a critical influence on the quality of the manufactured components. In particular, metal powder cross-contamination originating from insufficient removal of foreign particles during multi-material processing can lead to undesired changes in material properties. In this paper, a suction device was simulated, designed, and validated to reduce cross-contamination. Requirements and necessary characteristic values of the multi-material PBF-LB/M system, the powder suction module, and the materials used were determined. Furthermore, an iterative simulative method and procedure for the design of suction devices was applied. For this purpose, a flattened bell-shaped geometry with flow-optimized fins was presented. This design led to both a high flow velocity and a homogenous velocity distribution at the nozzle inlet for full-surface multi-material PBF-LB/M suction modules. The developed method was validated by applying it to the material combination of tool steel 1.2709 and copper alloy CW106C. The aim was to reduce the cross-contamination generated during the in-process on an SLM 280HL multi-material PBF-LB/M system. Multi-material samples were built using the original nozzle design as well as the newly developed improved powder suction module and investigated in terms of resulting cross-contamination using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The improved suction module had a significantly higher flow velocity and a more homogenous velocity distribution at the nozzle inlet compared to the original suction module. Cross-contamination of the manufactured multi-material samples was reduced by up to 93 \% due to the improved suction model.},

This study estimates the net changes in supply-chain lead time, life cycle primary energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and life cycle costs (LCC) associated with AM technologies for the case of injection molding, to shed light on the environmental and economic advantages of a shift from international or onshore CM to AM in the United States. A systems modeling framework is developed, with integrations of lead-time analysis, life cycle inventory analysis, LCC model, and scenarios considering design differences, supply-chain options, productions, maintenance, and AM technological developments. AM yields a reduction potential of 3\% to 5\% primary energy, 4\% to 7\% GHG emissions, 12\% to 60\% lead time, and 15\% to 35\% cost over 1 million cycles of the injection molding production depending on the AM technology advancement in future. The economic advantages indicate the significant role of AM technology in raising global manufacturing competitiveness of local producers, while the relatively small environmental benefits highlight the necessity of considering trade-offs and balance techniques between environmental and economic performances when AM is adopted in the tooling industry. The results also help pinpoint the technological innovations in AM that could lead to broader benefits in future.},

Melt temperature, injection time, packing pressure, packing time, cooling time, and cooling temperature are taken as the design variables. A multi-objective optimization of the process parameters is then performed. First, the process parameters of conformal cooling channel are optimized. Numerical simulation in the PIM is so intensive that a sequential approximate optimization using a radial basis function network is used to identify a pareto-frontier. It is found from the numerical result that the cooling performance of conformal cooling channel is much improved, compared to the conventional cooling channel. Based on the numerical result, the conformal cooling channel is developed by using additive manufacturing technology. The experiment is then carried out to examine the validity of the conformal cooling channel. Through numerical and experimental result, it is confirmed that the conformal cooling channel is effective to the short cycle time and the warpage reduction.},

	abstract = {The present study reports the effect of laser parameters on the microstructure, and consequently, the wear resistance of laser surface engineered (hardening and melting) AISI H13 tool steel (in hardened and tempered condition) substrate. The microstructure of the laser surface hardened zone consists of ultrafine mixed carbides (M23C6, M7C3, MC or M2C) dispersed between martensite laths. On the other hand, a laser surface melted microstructure comprises retained austenite, martensite, transformed ledeburite and fine carbides precipitated in the inter-dendritic zone. Microhardness of the laser surface engineered zone is significantly enhanced to as high as 670–810 VHN as compared to 480–500 VHN of the as received quenched and tempered substrate and decreases along vertical depth from the surface until a narrow soft zone at the interface with a typical hardness of 440 VHN. Laser surface melting yields a higher hardness level (770±10 VHN) as compared to that after laser surface hardening (660±10 VHN). Wear resistance of laser surface engineered samples (evaluated both by ball-on-disk and fretting wear testing equipments) shows a significant improvement as compared to that in hardened and tempered condition. Due to an increased hardness, surface melting shows superior resistance to wear both under fretting as well as ball on disk wear testing conditions. A marginal improvement in corrosion resistance was also recorded in laser surface engineered samples due to microstructural/compositional homogenization introduced by laser surface engineering.},

	abstract = {Typical high-strength products are made from carbon-rich steels possessing relatively high carbon content, thus reducing weldability. In this work, preliminary studies on designing and tailoring a low-alloyed steel for the laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) process by adding carbon black (C) nanoparticles and tungsten carbide (WC) particles for enhancing the material properties are provided. First, the base material 16MnCr5 is modified with different concentrations of C and WC. It was found that an increased C and WC content resulted in an elevated material hardness in the as-built state. However, this comes at the cost of a poorer processability as pore formation increased for C-modified and crack tendency increased for WC-modified 16MnCr5. When applying a post-process quenching and optional tempering heat treatment, material hardness in the range of 615 HV can be achieved for C-enriched 16MnCr5 in the tempered state, which would be suitable for bearing and gearing applications. The addition of WC particles favored an improved wear resistance which is twice as high as the one of C-modified material for similar material hardness, showing the enormous potential of WC addition for reducing the wear rate. Complementary SEM and EDX analyses show that both the dilution and bonding zone of the WC particles are affected by the processing conditions and the WC concentration. Furthermore, it was found that a nearly defect-free fabrication of WC-enriched 16MnCr5 was possible for up to 2.5 wt.-\% of WC, proving that the occurring defects are highly sensitive to the WC concentration.},

In the powder bed fusion process of metals using a laser beam (PBF-LB/M), usually, pre-alloyed metal powder is solidified layer-by-layer using a laser beam to create parts. A reduction of the carbon content in steels is observed during this process. This study examines adding carbon particles to the metal powder and in situ alloying in the PBF-LB/M process as a countermeasure. Suitable carbon particles are selected and their effect on the particle size distribution and homogeneity of the mixtures is analysed. The workability in PBF-LB is then shown. This is followed by an evaluation of the resulting mechanical properties (hardness and mechanical strength) and microstructure in the as-built state and the state after heat treatment. Furthermore, potential use cases like multi-material or functionally graded parts are discussed.},

	abstract = {By using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) in the tooling industry, tools with complex geometries and integrated functions, such as adapted cooling channels, can be manufactured with high potential in terms of product lifetimes or cycle times. When processing tool steels with a carbon content {\textgreater} 0.6 wt.-\% by means of LPBF, hard and brittle phases are formed as well as soft retained austenite and carbides. Combined with high internal stresses in the part this often leads to crack formation. Using base plate preheating up to 500 °C can enable the production of crack free components, however, to increase the processability of high-speed steel, varying the alloy composition by stabilizing austenite could lead to reduced residual stresses. In this study, we investigate the processability and microstructure of high-speed steel HS6-5-3-8 reference and HS6-5-3-8 with increased carbon content by rapid alloy development (RAD) in the LPBF process. The manufactured specimens are analysed based on part density, hardness, microstructure, and homogeneity of the microstructure. Light-optical and electron microscopic methods (i.e. SEM, EDS, EBSD) are used for microstructure investigations. We found that an increased carbon content in the alloy leads to an increased carbide volume fraction and a fully austenitic matrix. However, contrary to the hypothesized beneficial impact of austenite stabilization on crack formation, we observe a worsening of cracking with C content. Based on these results, we discuss which microstructural features are the deciding factors for cold cracking in LPBF of high-carbon steels. Based on the results, a relationship between alloy composition of high-speed steel and their processability is discussed and the application of RAD by means of LPBF is assessed.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) addresses various benefits as the buildup of complex shaped parts, the possibility of functional integration, reduced lead times or the use of difficult machinable materials compared to conventional manufacturing possibilities. Beside these advantages, the use of more than one material in a component would strongly increase the field of applications in typical AM branches as energy, aerospace, or medical technology. By means of multi-material buildups, cost-intensive alloys could be only used in high-loaded areas of the part, whereas the remaining part could be fabricated with cheaper compositions. The selection of combined materials strongly depends on the requested thermophysical but also mechanical properties. Within this contribution, examples (e.g., used in the turbine business) show how alloys can be arranged to fit together, e.g., in terms of a well-chosen coefficient of thermal expansion. As can be seen in nature, the multi-material usage can be characterized by sharp intersections from one material to the other (e.g., in case of a thin corrosion protection), but also by graded structures enabling a smoother material transition (e.g., in case of dissimilar materials which are joined together without defects). The latter is shown for an example from aerospace within this paper. Another possibility is the simultaneous placement of several materials, e.g., hard carbide particles placed in a more ductile matrix composition. These particles can be varied in size (e.g., TiC versus WC). Also the ratio between carbides and matrix alloy can be adjusted depending on its application. Especially, nozzle-based free form fabrication technologies, e.g., laser metal deposition, enable the utilization of more than one material. Within this contribution, possibilities to feed more than one filler material are demonstrated. In addition, results of multi-material processes are shown. Finally, this work focuses on different (potential) applications, mainly on power generation, but also for medical technology or wear resistant components.},

	abstract = {H11 hot work tool steel (1.2343) belongs to the most commonly used materials in the tooling industry, with significant heritage in producing extrusion dies or injection molds. Those components often are characterized by complex geometries, which makes them a great candidate for additive manufacturing. However, the hot working steel is hard to process by additive manufacturing technologies due to its cracking susceptibility related to high cooling rates occurring during printing. A potential way to reduce cracking tendencies is to utilize a point-by-point laser scanning methodology which influecnes the thermal conditions of the process. To prove this, a series of samples were produced via Powder Bed Fusion with various manufacturing parameters and without build platform preheating. Produced samples have been investigated by light and scanning electron microscopy methods, X-ray analysis, and hardness tests. The obtained results indicate that the use of short laser pulses in Powder Bed Fusion can limit the cracking in printed parts. In addition, the laser pulses play an important role in shaping the microstructure of the processed H11 hot work tool steel. The optimal parameters limiting the crack density to 6 mm−2 with 0.1 \% porosity in H11 steel printouts were determined.},

	abstract = {The embrittlement of the fusion boundary region of Ni–base Alloy 625 overlay welds on AISI 8630 steel was evaluated. Metallurgical characterization, thermodynamic and kinetic simulations, and hydrogen charging experiments were conducted in an effort to identify the embrittlement mechanism and simulate the type of failures that occur in service under cathodic protection. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron backscattered diffraction, electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffraction, and hardness mapping were all used to characterize the microstructure and assist in identifying the microstructural features in the transition region of this dissimilar alloy combination that can promote susceptibility to hydrogen-assisted cracking (HAC). A special low-angle sectioning technique was developed that expanded the very narrow transition zone between the Alloy 625 overlay and the heat-affected zone of the 8630 steel. Using this technique, a “featureless zone” resulting from planar solidification was evaluated. This was the region in which HAC was observed during service under cathodic protection. Carbon migration studies conducted using Dictra™ showed that considerable carbon buildup (over 1 wt.\%) occurs in the transition zone during postweld heat treatment. This level of carbon was confirmed using electron probe microanalysis. The high carbon content stabilizes the austenite phase in this region and results in local hardness levels exceeding 500 VHN. Metallographic sections of samples that failed under cathodic charging revealed that cracking occurs preferentially within this hardened region. The paper describes the metallurgical basis for the formation of this transition zone in weld overlays of Ni–base filler metals on carbon steels.},

A difference in physical properties between these two materials creates cracks at their interface where were fully explored using metallographic examination and numerical simulation. It is found cracks easily occur at their interface near nickel side due to alternate thermal cycles that lead to a variation in residual stress and microstructure, including grain orientation, texture strength, dislocation density and Schmid factors.

When severe damage occurs, an alternative to replacing the whole component consists of the repair by laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED). For that end, intermediate layers are commonly employed as buffer material, where introducing a functionally graded material (FGM) might be beneficial to avoid material incompatibilities and improve the overall performance of the tooling. In the present work, an FGM composed of gradient AISI 316L to AISI H13 has been manufactured, and its microstructure and hardness analysed. Firstly, cracking owing to the formation of brittle intermediate phases has been detected. Secondly, an increase of the hardness and a decrease of the corrosion resistance has been observed when transitioning from AISI 316L to AISI H13. Thirdly, despite the FGM composition evolving linearly, nonlinear material properties such as hardness and corrosion have been observed, which are conditioned by the microstructure formed during the L‑DED process and the nonlinear influence of the composition of steel on such properties. Consequently, nonlinear compositional gradients are recommended if linear mechanical properties are to be obtained in the case of steel FGMs.},

The composite, particularly with nanoscale TiC, also exhibited greater room- and high-temperature compressive yield strengths than unreinforced steel, mainly because of the combined effects of grain-boundary strengthening and Orowan strengthening. The strengthening effect was well described by the Zener pinning model. The compressed surfaces suggest that TiC particles hinder crack propagation, and the TiC distribution was critical in improving the mechanical properties. The SLM process can tailor the microstructure across a rather limited length scale; hence, to better control the mechanical properties of the resulting products, compositing the relevant feedstock powder is a highly attractive strategy for developing components with novel structures and unique properties.},

	abstract = {Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) steels’ qualities of radiation damage resistance and high strength at high temperature make them promising nuclear structural materials. However, the dispersed yttria that gives ODS steel its beneficial qualities are generally compromised during joining processes, making fabrication difficult and expensive. The selective laser sintering process offers a potential path through this barrier by which net-shape parts can feasibly be built via additive manufacturing without fully melting the structure. Rastering a 400W laser over a 110μm MA956 ODS steel powder bed, we additively built parts with varying build conditions. Although density was achieved to within 97\% of the wrought MA956, ultimate tensile strengths achieved only 65\% of the wrought strength. Spectroscopy analysis points to the agglomeration of the yttria nano-particles as a possible explanation for the loss in strength. Further study might benefit from exploration of other parameters such as thinner powder build layers which would require less energy input to achieve sintering while minimizing time above the melting temperature.},

The composite contained 1 wt.\% TiN and the average diameters of AISI 420 and TiN powders were 45 µm and 1 µm, respectively. The powder for SLMing the TiN/AISI 420 composite was prepared using a novel two-stage mixing scheme. The morphology, mechanical, and corrosion properties of the specimens were analyzed, and their correlations with microstructures were investigated. The results showed that the surface roughness of both SLM samples decreases with increasing VED, while relative densities greater than 99\% were achieved at VEDs higher than 160 J/mm3. The SLM AISI 420 specimen fabricated at a VED of 205 J/mm3 exhibited the highest density of 7.7 g/cm3, tensile strength (UTS) of 1270 MPa, and elongation of 3.86\%. The SLM TiN/AISI 420 specimen at a VED of 285 J/mm3 had a density of 7.67 g/cm3, UTS of 1482 MPa, and elongation of 2.72\%. The microstructure of the SLM TiN/AISI 420 composite displayed a ring-like micro-grain structure consisting of retained austenite on the grain boundary and martensite in the grain. The TiN particles strengthened the mechanical properties of the composite by accumulating along the grain boundary. The mean hardnesses of the SLM AISI 420 and TiN/AISI 420 specimens were 635 and 735 HV, respectively, which exceeded previously reported results. The SLM TiN/AISI 420 composite exhibited excellent corrosion resistance in both 3.5 wt.\% NaCl and 6 wt.\% FeCl3 solutions, with a resulting corrosion rate as low as 11 µm/year.},

The microstructural analysis indicates that the WC particle was either partially or fully melted during SLM process with a homogenous distribution. Moreover, a phase transition from α-Fe to γ (Fe, Ni) appears after adding WC reinforcement. The TEM was used to investigate the interfacial structure between WC and maraging steel with focus on the elemental distribution, which indicates the W element was diffused via grain boundary and hold back the α to γ transition. Microhardness and ball-on-disc test are employed to determine their wear properties.

In this work, preliminary studies on designing and tailoring a low-alloyed steel for the laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) process by adding carbon black (C) nanoparticles and tungsten carbide (WC) particles for enhancing the material properties are provided. First, the base material 16MnCr5 is modified with different concentrations of C and WC. It was found that an increased C and WC content resulted in an elevated material hardness in the as-built state. However, this comes at the cost of a poorer processability as pore formation increased for C-modified and crack tendency increased for WC-modified 16MnCr5. When applying a post-process quenching and optional tempering heat treatment, material hardness in the range of 615 HV can be achieved for C-enriched 16MnCr5 in the tempered state, which would be suitable for bearing and gearing applications. The addition of WC particles favored an improved wear resistance which is twice as high as the one of C-modified material for similar material hardness, showing the enormous potential of WC addition for reducing the wear rate. Complementary SEM and EDX analyses show that both the dilution and bonding zone of the WC particles are affected by the processing conditions and the WC concentration. Furthermore, it was found that a nearly defect-free fabrication of WC-enriched 16MnCr5 was possible for up to 2.5 wt.-\% of WC, proving that the occurring defects are highly sensitive to the WC concentration.},

	abstract = {The performance enhancement of laser additive manufactured components depends on structural innovation and tailored printing, and the naturally optimized structures can provide inspiration for design and manufacturing. In this work, a layered TiB2/Ti6Al4V structure inspired by the biological structure of the Crysomallon squamiferum shell was designed and built by multi-material laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The mechanisms for material densification, element diffusion, interfacial reaction, crystal growth and performance enhancement of multi-material LPBF-processed layered TiB2/Ti6Al4V parts were revealed by experiments and simulations. A strategy of process optimization by alternating appropriate printing parameters for metallic and ceramic materials yielded fully dense multi-material parts without discernible interfacial defects. The microstructure control showed that TiB whiskers were generated by the in-situ reaction between TiB2 and Ti matrix, yielding a sound metallurgical bonding between dissimilar materials. The gradient elements and microstructures induced the gradually changed microhardness at the interface, thereby reducing the abrupt change and incoordination of microstructure and properties at the interface. The excellent flexural performance with a strength of 2033.2 MPa and a strain of 7.8\% was obtained for the laser printed of TiB2/Ti6Al4V multi-material parts, revealing the contribution of the high interfacial bonding between layers to the performance enhancement. The internal crack propagation in laser-fabricated parts was fulfilled by crack deflection and multistage cracking, which extended the propagation path and increased the crack propagation energy. The flexural strength and ductility of LPBF-fabricated TiB2/Ti6Al4V multi-material parts were enhanced by the combined effects of the bio-inspired layered composite structure and the interior whiskers-structured reinforcement. This study sheds light on the manufacturing and strengthening of ceramic/metal multi-material using laser additive manufacturing technology.},

Additive manufacturing (AM) provides a new opportunity for producing FGMs. However, current metal AM technologies including powder-bed fusion are limited to producing single material components or vertical FGM parts, i.e., a different material composition in different layers but not within the same layer, and in situ changing materials is challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of horizontal and 3D 316L/Cu10Sn components with FGM within the same layer and in different layers, via a proprietary multiple selective powder delivery array device incorporated into a selective laser melting system that allowed the deposition of up to six different materials point by point. The manufactured component macrostructure, microstructure, microhardness, and phases were examined. Smooth transition from one material to the other was realized. Also, an interesting phenomenon was found that the maximum hardness was at 50\% 316L and 50\% Cu10Sn. The work would open up a new opportunity for the manufacturing of true 3D functionally graded components using additive manufacturing and for the rapid development of new metal alloy systems.},

Relationships among laser parameter, interfacial characteristic and mechanical performance are elucidated. A metallurgical bonded interface with a 30–40 μm inter-diffusion region is formed. Gradient submicro grains with strong 〈111〉 orientation exhibit at the interface, which owe to high cooling rate and temperature gradient caused by high thermal conductive copper. A selected region of the interface was extracted by focused ion beam (FIB) for interfacial bonding analysis. The bonding mechanism is revealed and illustrated in detail. Interfacial intense Marangoni flows pull the copper toward the molten pool of maraging steel and the liquid maraging steel penetrates into the melting copper, which contributes to interfacial bonding. The bonding strength of hybrid processed bimetals are evaluated. Fracture in tensile is not present at the interface but on the copper side. The highest flexural strength reaches 557 MPa, which is slightly higher than that of the copper. Effects of parameter on fracture behaviors are also elucidated. This hybrid manufacture increases the productivity and functionality of the direct SLM-produced part, and provides a new approach for producing high-performance functional dissimilar bimetals based on laser additive manufacture.},

	abstract = {In the present work, a numerical-statistical approach was used to study the distortion and residual stress in the additive manufacturing (AM) of SS316L-IN718 multi-material structure. Also, the structure was fabricated by laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED), and experimental measurements via thermocouple and micro X-ray diffraction were performed to validate the numerical results. In a good agreement with the experiments, the thermomechanical modeling of the process showed that through-thickness residual stresses (build direction) are distributed as a large accumulation of compressive residual stress in the mid-length of the structure-substrate interface and the maximum tensile residual stress at its two free ends. The critical development of longitudinal residual stresses (scanning direction) at the interface of the structure due to the sudden change in properties has caused the formation of the maximum tensile residual stress (up to 475 MPa) in this area and immediately changed its nature to compressive that can easily lead to localized cracking. Besides, Von Mises stress distribution indicated the concentration of stress at the interfaces of structure-substrate and base alloys, in such a way that it causes yielding in the SS316L section. On the contrary, less (plastic) strain occurred in the IN718 section due to higher yield strength. The results of the statistical modeling using multiple response analysis in the response surface method (RSM) also determined the desirable minimum level of longitudinal strain and stress of the structure (about 0.013 and 320 MPa, respectively) in the laser power range of 300–380 W and the powder per unit length of 5–25 g/m. In addition to minimization, it was demonstrated that sharp changes in longitudinal strain and stress at the interface of multi-material structure can be effectively reformed to mild changes by designing compositional gradients through thermodynamic calculations, owing to the approximation of the properties of adjacent layers.},

However, conventional CAD systems are limited in the representation of such parts. This issue is exacerbated when lattice structures are combined or embedded within a complex geometry. This paper presents a computationally efficient, voxel-based method of generating lattices comprised of practically any cell type that can conform to an arbitrary external geometry. The method of conforming involves the tessellation and trimming of unit cells that can leave ‘hanging’ struts at the surface, which is a possible point of weakness in the structure. A method of joining these struts to form an external two dimensional lattice, termed a ‘net-skin’ is also described. Traditional methods of manufacturing lattice structures generally do not allow variation of cell properties within a structure; however, additive manufacturing enables graded lattices to be generated that are potentially more optimal. A method of functionally grading lattices is, therefore, also described to take advantage of this manufacturing capability.},

Firstly, a tool to create isotropic randomness, secondly, a way to create anisotropic randomness, thirdly, an approach to create graded randomness, fourthly, a feature to create layered randomness controlled by a function, and finally, we create a lattice with stochastic surface roughness.

Here, we present a methodology where a Gaussian distribution can be superimposed on any regular array of parametric unit cells. The standard deviation controls the randomness. The distance between unit cells is evaluated and used to define different parameters. This allows using different randomness for each parameter and prevents overlaps. Aspect ratios are introduced to define interdependent parameters. The methodology presented here provides a template for researchers to more accurately mimic the engineering performance of biological structures across multi-physics problems. This new design methodology lends itself perfectly to additive manufacturing.},

The analysis and data span a wide range of processes from “conventional” processes such as machining, casting, and injection molding, to the so-called “advanced machining” processes such as electrical discharge machining and abrasive waterjet machining, and to the vapor-phase processes used in semiconductor and nanomaterials fabrication. In all, 20 processes are analyzed. The results show that the intensity of materials and energy used per unit of mass of material processed (measured either as specific energy or exergy) has increased by at least 6 orders of magnitude over the past several decades. The increase of material/energy intensity use has been primarily a consequence of the introduction of new manufacturing processes, rather than changes in traditional technologies. This phenomenon has been driven by the desire for precise small-scale devices and product features and enabled by stable and declining material and energy prices over this period. We illustrate the relevance of thermodynamics (including exergy analysis) for all processes in spite of the fact that long-lasting focus in manufacturing has been on product quality—not necessarily energy/material conversion efficiency. We promote the use of thermodynamics tools for analysis of manufacturing processes within the context of rapidly increasing relevance of sustainable human enterprises. We confirm that exergy analysis can be used to identify where resources are lost in these processes, which is the first step in proposing and/or redesigning new more efficient processes.},

The application, however, also requires energy and resources for e.g. cutting fluid supply or chip treatment. Alternatively, the strategy of dry machining does not require cutting fluids and therefore claims to be more beneficial in terms of costs and environmental impact than wet machining. In order to assess the actual performance, it is important to comprehensively consider and analyze all possible impacts of alternative strategies on the elements of a machining system. This paper proposes a concept, which integrates the modeling of relevant influences depending on the strategy. The general applicability of the concept is shown within a case study, where the modeling results are compared with experimental results for a turning process and evaluated for different scenarios.},

To get a generalized statement about the energy consumption of the investigated processes the electrical energy demand was extrapolated as a function of the material removal ratio. The results indicate that hybrid manufacturing becomes beneficial from an environmental point of view compared to milling, when the material removal ratio exceeds 55\%. The electrical break-even point for selective laser melting is approximated to 82\% material removal ratio from data extrapolation. Subsequently, opportunities for electrical energy and material efficiency improvements are presented for these technologies to gain an understanding of how each can contribute to a more sustainable manufacturing landscape.},

Globalization is a weapon the rich use to exploit the poor. Globalization builds bridges across national boundaries. Globalization fuels the populism and great-power competition that is tearing the world apart.When it comes to the politics of free trade and open borders, the camps are dug in, producing a kaleidoscope of claims and counterclaims, unlikely alliances, and unexpected foes. But what exactly are we fighting about? And how might we approach these issues more productively? Anthea Roberts and Nicolas Lamp cut through the confusion with an indispensable survey of the interests, logics, and ideologies driving these intractable debates, which lie at the heart of so much political dispute and decision making. The authors expertly guide us through six competing narratives about the virtues and vices of globalization: the old establishment view that globalization benefits everyone (win-win), the pessimistic belief that it threatens us all with pandemics and climate change (lose-lose), along with various rival accounts that focus on specific winners and losers, from China to America’s Rust Belt.Instead of picking sides, Six Faces of Globalization gives all these positions their due, showing how each deploys sophisticated arguments and compelling evidence. Both globalization’s boosters and detractors will come away with their eyes opened. By isolating the fundamental value conflicts—growth versus sustainability, efficiency versus social stability—driving disagreement and showing where rival narratives converge, Roberts and Lamp provide a holistic framework for understanding current debates. In doing so, they showcase a more integrative way of thinking about complex problems.},

	abstract = {The dependence on conventional metal cutting technologies to satisfy consumer demands for more customised products and services is contributing to the generation of ever-increasing metallic waste in the form of machining chips (MCs). Metallic MCs are of high value if recycled by sustainable techniques. Conventional recycling by melting the MCs for industrious use is neither economical nor environment friendly. Thus, the advanced technologies for clean recycling of MCs for industrious use are the need of the hour. In this paper, consideration is given to the role of one such advanced recycling technology: ball milling (BM). The efficacy of BM for recycling MCs by converting them into chip powder (CP) is evaluated. The produced chip powder (CP) can be utilized as feedstock powder in various powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing processes like laser engineered net shaping (LENS) and electron beam melting (EBM) for the manufacturing of near-net shaped products. The consequences of adopting this novel recycling technology on industrial sustainability are not well understood and this exploratory study draws on publicly available data to provide insights into the impacts of BM on sustainability. Benefits of BM are found to exist which include promising results in obtaining 70–90\% sphericity with the utilization of 20–30\% less energy in comparison to conventional powder production techniques. As an immature technology, there are substantial challenges to these benefits being realised. This paper summarises these advantages, challenges, and discusses the implications of BM as sustainable recycling technology in terms of process parameters on the mechanical, physical, and morphological properties of the CP produced. In addition, a framework is presented which suggests the plausible methodology for recycling MCs into CP from the generation stage to the final utilization stage.},

	abstract = {Machining chips are a potentially versatile material feedstock to be used in a range of solid-state and melt based manufacturing processes. The poor current understanding of the behaviour of chips in such processes limits the likelihood of practical adoption of such materials on an industrial scale. The re-use (as opposed to recycling or landfilling) of machining waste offers both economic and environmental savings. Iron and steel production causes up to 9 \%, and aluminium up to 1.5 \% of global process and energy CO2 emissions. It is proposed that between 0.24 \% and 0.5 \% (117 Mt CO2) of global CO2 emissions could be saved by reusing steel machining chips and between 0.13 \% and 0.22 \% (51 Mt CO2) via re-use of aluminium chips, through mitigation of recycling associated emissions or emissions from generation of new steel. Re-use of large manufacturing scrap, i.e. the majority of such scrap, increases these values to savings of 1 \% and 0.86 \% of global CO2 emissions for steel and aluminium respectively in the best scenario. This work gives a perspective on the potential for chips to retain value and be re-used in manufacturing process streams. The paper guides the reader from the generation and control of machining chips, to the principles of material consolidation. The principles of material densification by both solid state and laser deposition based methods are described, and current and potential manufacturing processes which can use chips as a feedstock are critically reviewed in terms of their practicalities and final properties. A perspective on potential CO2 savings is described, providing the underpinning motivation behind this work. It is shown there is significant potential for versatile manufacturing using machining chips by both solid-state and laser-based processing of chips into finished products. An argument is also presented for a new approach to processing large-scrap, e.g. from the automotive manufacturing industry, as well as end-of-life automotive scrap, into smaller chips ready for re-use.},

	abstract = {Directed energy deposition (DED) is an additive manufacturing process capable of creating parts or coatings from powder or wire feedstocks, and may be adapted to use machining chips. Re-use of steel chips as opposed to landfilling or even recycling, has implications for CO2 emission savings. This is particularly the case of like-for-like replacement of powder and other feedstocks. This work addresses two key concerns which currently impede the implementation of chip-based DED – the impact of residual coolant present on chips on part properties, and whether chip type feedstocks can be delivered in a consistent, practical manner similar to powders. The study demonstrates that DED can generate dense, repeatable deposits from 304L stainless steel milling chips, using both pre-placed and vibrationally fed strategies. Milling chips created with and without the use of machining coolant can both be successfully deposited, without compromising the density of the part. EPMA/XRD/EBSD analysis showed no evidence of coolant in deposits, explained by rapid evaporation, and micro-hardness analysis showed it had no effect on hardness. Practical implementation of chip-based feedstocks into DED systems is validated via use of a bespoke vibration feeding system, which is calibrated in this work, and capable of controlled delivery beneath the laser. Melting behaviour under low power is also investigated, revealing chips are readily melted into droplets and incorporate surrounding chips, ultimately yielding efficient material incorporation into tracks.},

	abstract = {Controlling the heat input and exploring alternate feedstocks for DED is necessary to improve the versatility of this technique. A novel approach DED is investigated by implementing a new control method for energy beam scanning oscillation and utilising a new feedstock: metallic meshes. This represents the first exploration of ‘laser mesh cladding (LMC)’. Under certain conditions, the clads show similar results of wire and powder DED producing dense clads with no large pores, grain refinements at the edges of the clads and a layer height of 0.6 mm. Secondly, with the same laser process parameters for two different meshes, LMC produced fully dense clads with the denser mesh creating slightly smaller melted area. This then manifests as a new cladding operation where material input and energy input can be manipulated during the deposition for a total process flexibility.},

	abstract = {Current biomimetic designs do not incorporate naturally occurring variance. Instead, the same unit cell is repeatedly copied and pasted to create a pattern. Existing stochastic designs use the same randomness for all parameters. However, nature teaches us that unit cells vary over several geometry defining parameters and that unit cells rarely overlap. Here, we present a methodology where a Gaussian distribution can be superimposed on any regular array of parametric unit cells. The standard deviation controls the randomness. The distance between unit cells is evaluated and used to define different parameters. This allows using different randomness for each parameter and prevents overlaps. Aspect ratios are introduced to define interdependent parameters. The methodology presented here provides a template for researchers to more accurately mimic the engineering performance of biological structures across multi-physics problems. This new design methodology lends itself perfectly to additive manufacturing.},
