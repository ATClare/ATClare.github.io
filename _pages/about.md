Welcome! I am a Professor at the University of British Columbia, Canada, having worked for 15 years in manufacturing research in both academia and industry. I have secured funding for research from numerous sources (research councils and industrial partners) and my research has led to the formation of two spin out companies and numerous exploited patents. I have published over 200 papers in leading international and peer reviewed journals and hold several patents. I serve as Editor-in-Chief of Additive Manufacturing.

I have taught across a number of topics including manufacturing processes, additive manufacturing, design and materials processing.

I also maintain links with a research team at the University of Nottingham, UK, which has activities across non-conventional machining processes and additive manufacturing/3D printing. Our collaborators include Rolls-Royce and Oerlikon but we also engage internationally with leading research groups from Japan, USA, Germany and China.
